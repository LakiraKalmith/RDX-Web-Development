[31m-[m
[31m-Thomas Hoenig woke up early on November 3, 2010, knowing what he had to[m
[31m-do that day, and also knowing that he was almost certainly going to fail. He was[m
[31m-going to cast a vote, and he was going to vote no. He was going to dissent, and he[m
[31m-knew that this dissent would probably de ne his legacy. Hoenig was trying to[m
[31m-stop something: A public policy that he believed could very well turn into a[m
[31m-catastrophe. He believed it was his duty to do so. But the wheels were already[m
[31m-turning to make this policy a reality, and the wheels were far more powerful than[m
[31m-he was. The wheels were powered by the big banks on Wall Street, the stock[m
[31m-market, and the leadership of America’s Federal Reserve Bank. Everyone knew[m
[31m-that Hoenig was going to lose that day, but he was going to vote no anyway.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-   HoenigI was sixty-four years old, and he was the president of the Federal[m
[31m-Reserve Bank of Kansas City, a position that gave him extraordinary power over[m
[31m-America’s economic a airs. He was in Washington that morning because he sat[m
[31m-on the Federal Reserve’s powerful policy-making committee, which met every six[m
[31m-weeks to e ectively determine the value and quantity of American money. Most[m
[31m-people in America don’t think very much about money—meaning the actual[m
[31m-currency, or that thing we call a dollar. The word dollar is, in fact, just a slang[m
[31m-term for American currency, which is actually called a Federal Reserve note.[m
[31m-People spend Federal Reserve notes every day (if they’re lucky enough to have[m
[31m-them), but they rarely think about the complex, largely invisible system that[m
[31m-makes money appear out of thin air. This system is the U.S. Federal Reserve[m
[31m-System. The Fed, America’s central bank, is the only institution on Earth that[m
[31m-can create U.S. dollars at will.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-   Because he was a senior o cial at the Federal Reserve, Thomas Hoenig had to[m
[31m-think about money all the time. He thought about it in the same way that a very[m
[31m-stressed-out building superintendent might think about plumbing and heating.[m
[31m-Hoenig had to think about money as a system to be managed, and to be[m
[31m-managed just right. When you ran the system that created money, you had to do[m
[31m-your job carefully, with prudence and integrity, or else terrible things might[m
[31m-happen. The building might ood or catch on re.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-   This is why Hoenig felt so much pressure when he woke up that November[m
[31m-morning in Washington, D.C. He was staying at a very nice hotel, called the[m
[31m-Fairmont, where he always stayed when he traveled from his home in Kansas[m
[31m-City to the nation’s capital. Hoenig was in town for the regular meeting of the[m
[31m-Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC for short. When the committee[m
[31m-met in Washington, its members voted and set the course of the Fed’s actions.[m
[31m-There were twelve members on the committee, which was run by the powerful[m
[31m-chairman of the Federal Reserve.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-   For a year now, Hoenig had been voting no. If you tallied his votes during[m
[31m-2010, the tally would read: no, no, no, no, no, and no. His dissents had become[m
[31m-expected, but they were also startling if you considered Tom Hoenig’s character.[m
[31m-He wasn’t, by nature, anything close to a dissident. He was a rule-follower. He[m
[31m-was born and raised in a small town, where he started working at the family[m
[31m-plumbing shop before he was ten years old. He served as an artilleryman in[m
[31m-Vietnam, and when he came home he didn’t protest against the war. Instead, he[m
[31m-studied economics and banking at Iowa State, earning a PhD. His rst job out of[m
[31m-school was as an economist with the Federal Reserve regional bank in Kansas[m
[31m-City, in the supervision department. At the Fed, he went from being a rule-[m
[31m-follower to being a rule-enforcer. Hoenig rose through the ranks to became[m
[31m-president of the Kansas City Fed in 1991. This was the job he still held in 2010.[m
[31m-His responsibilities as one of twelve regional Fed bank presidents illuminate the[m
[31m-structure of America’s money system. The Federal Reserve system is unlike any[m
[31m-other in the world; it is a crazy genetic mashup of di erent animals, part private[m
[31m-bank and part government agency. People talk about the Fed as if it were a bank,[m
[31m-but it is really a network of regional banks, all controlled by a central o ce in[m
[31m-Washington, D.C. Hoenig had all the ery disposition that one might expect[m
[31m-from a regional Fed president, which is to say none at all. He was soft-spoken,[m
[31m-civil, wore cu links and pin-striped suits, and spent his days talking about[m
[31m-things like capital requirements and interest rates. Hoenig was an[m
[31m-institutionalist, and a conservative in the little “c” sense of the word.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-   And yet here he was, in late 2010, a dissident.[m
[31m-   After he woke up in his hotel room, Hoenig had some time alone before the[m
[31m-big day started. He gathered his thoughts. He shaved, put on a suit, knotted his[m
[31m-tie, and gathered his papers. If he had any doubts about what he was going to do[m
[31m-that day, he didn’t advertise them. He had spent months, years, even decades[m
[31m-preparing for this action. His vote would re ect everything he’d learned during[m
[31m-his career at the Fed. He was trying to apply what he knew to help the Federal[m
[31m-Reserve navigate through extraordinary times.[m
[31m-   The American nancial system had broken in late 2008, after the investment[m
[31m-bank Lehman Brothers collapsed. That moment marked a threshold for people[m
[31m-like Tom Hoenig. Economists and central bankers describe the ensuing panic as[m
[31m-the Global Financial Crisis, eventually bestowing the moment with its own[m
[31m-biblical label, the GFC. The world of central banking was neatly divided into[m
[31m-two eras. There was the world pre-GFC and the world post-GFC. The GFC[m
[31m-itself was apocalyptic. The entire nancial
